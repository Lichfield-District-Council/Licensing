# Licensing Application

This app shows licensing applications to be easily shown on a council website, with advanced search and alerts functionality. Data is also available via XML, JavaScript and JSON.

There is a `Rake` task available that imports data in a specific format, exported from Uniform. See `examples` for an example of the format used.

The app is a generic Padrino app using Mongodb and the Mongomapper Ruby ORM.
